Does exactly what you think this mod does: horizontally extend the level editor *really* far.\
No frills, no softtoggles, no crashes, no fuss.\
<cy>*Shh... it just works!*</c>

<cr>None of the developers of GrandEditorExtender can be held responsible for objects being placed at inaccurate positions.</c> <cl>This is an issue as old as time, and the "solution" to this "problem" is either by inventing quadruple-precision floating-point numbers or finding something better to do with your time (such as hiring a level merger to do the dirty work for you.)</c>
